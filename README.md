===========

This is a game developed in pure Java within 10 weeks with 3 other teammates: Han Jiang, Issac Lam Bowie Wong.

- Game name: Dark Destiny
- Game type: Real Time Strategy game
- Game theme: zombie-themed survival game
- Language: Java
- Development team: 4 people
- Development time: 10 weeks
- No additional library or game engine

===========

System requirement:

1. Our game run stable under any os with Java 1.6_65 (Mac 10.9 Mavericks default comes with Java 1.6_65) 

2. 1 GB free memory for JVM Mac 10.9 Mavericks 10.9.0 or above 1. Import DarkDensity under /src to your IDE (It is suggested to use MyEclipse or Jetbrains Idea)

===========

How to run:

1 Change the JRE environment to Java 1.6_65 as there are some new bugs in 1.7

2. Allocate at least 1 GB memory to your JVM (i.e.: Add "-Xms1024m -Xmx1024m" to your JVM argument)

3. Click ?Run? in your IDE, and choose the main class as com.darkdensity.main.Main

4. Make sure that you are using Java 1.6_65 and sufficient memory is allocated to your JVM, If you are running on Java1.7, your screen may keep flashing and the control is not stable. This is a bug in Java 1.7 and old version Java Insufficient memory may cause the game crashed.

For other OS It is suggested to run our game under Java 1.6_65 environment. We have done some testing on 1.6_45 , 1.7 and 1.8. However it is not guaranteed that our game runs stable in these version of Java as there are some bugs in Swing and Graphics for those version and cannot be fixed in code level. After getting Java 1.6_65, follows the instructions with Mac 10.9 Mavericks 10.9.0 or above
